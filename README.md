# LoboWeather
Simple weather app built for Android to demonstrate skill to potential employers

## Notes
* You will need to get your own AppId from https://openweathermap.org/. Put it in the right place in strings.xml. 
* The app saves the AppId after first-run so you don't need to keep it in source control
